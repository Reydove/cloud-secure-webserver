## 🧠 Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world deployment and security hardening of a cloud server. You’ll go from launching an EC2 instance to securing it against brute-force attacks and enabling HTTPS.

**Goals:**
- Launch an Ubuntu EC2 instance
- Install and configure NGINX
- Enforce SSH key authentication
- Configure UFW firewall
- Protect SSH with Fail2Ban
- Enable HTTPS with Let’s Encrypt
