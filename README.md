 üß† Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world deployment and security hardening of a cloud server. You‚Äôll go from launching an EC2 instance to securing it against brute-force attacks and enabling HTTPS.

Goals:
- Launch an Ubuntu EC2 instance
- Install and configure NGINX
- Enforce SSH key authentication
- Configure UFW firewall
- Protect SSH with Fail2Ban
- Enable HTTPS with Let‚Äôs Encrypt

 Setup Instructions

Each step below is broken into commands and reasoning.

1. Launch EC2 Instance
We begin by launching an EC2 instance using the AWS Management Console.

Configuration:
Name: secure-nginx-server
-AMI: Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS (HVM)
- Instance Type:t2.micro (Free Tier)
-SSH Key Pair: A new key was created and downloaded for secure access.
- Security Group Rules:
  - SSH (port 22) ‚Äî Only my IP
  - HTTP (port 80) ‚Äî Open to all
  - HTTPS (port 443) ‚Äî Open to all

This setup ensures we start with minimal exposure to threats, following the principle of **least privilege**.

_(More steps to be filled as you go along)_

2. Connect via SSH

Once the EC2 instance is running, we connect from our Mac using the SSH key.

 Steps:

1. Move the downloaded `.pem` file to a secure folder:
    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/.ssh/aws
    mv ~/Downloads/secure-server.pem ~/.ssh/aws/
    chmod 400 ~/.ssh/aws/secure-server.pem
    ```

2. Connect to the server:
    ```bash
    ssh -i ~/.ssh/aws/secure-server.pem ubuntu@<your-ec2-public-ip>
    ```

> We use `chmod 400` to ensure the key isn‚Äôt publicly viewable ‚Äî SSH will reject insecure key files.

#### üì∏ SSH Connection Successful:
